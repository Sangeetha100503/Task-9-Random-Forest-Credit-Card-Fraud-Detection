Task-09: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

A machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on an imbalanced dataset and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. A Logistic Regression baseline is used for comparison, feature importance is visualized, and the best-performing model is saved as a .pkl file for reuse.
